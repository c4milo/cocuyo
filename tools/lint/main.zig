//! cocuyo lint: the rules of CLAUDE.md that a parser and a line scanner can check, one file per
//! rule under tools/lint/.
//!
//! Run:  zig build lint, which passes no `--rule`, so every rule registered here runs and checks
//! the build. `--rule NAME` runs one rule by hand.
//!
//! The driver is pepegrillo's: it walks every PATH, hands every regular file to every enabled
//! rule, reports a `.zig` file that does not parse under the `parse` pseudo-rule, and prints one
//! line per finding, sorted by path, line, column and rule, in the shape the Zig compiler prints
//! an error:
//!
//!     path:line:column: error: [rule-name] message
//!
//! Every rule here is pepegrillo's, configured in the file named after it. The one rule cocuyo
//! needs that no line scanner can check — that a module imports only what build/modules.zig gives
//! it — is tools/graph_check.zig, which asks the compiler instead.
//!
//! This tool is developer tooling. It is never linked into the library, so it allocates, reads the
//! filesystem, and is exempt from the rules it enforces over `src/`.
